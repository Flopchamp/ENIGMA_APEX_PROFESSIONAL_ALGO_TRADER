# üéâ SUCCESS! Your Trading Wheels App is LIVE! ‚úÖ

## **üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!**

**Your Trading Wheels Dashboard is now live at:**
**https://enigma-apex-professional-algo-trader.onrender.com**

## **üìã Understanding the Log Messages**

The warnings you're seeing are **NORMAL** and **expected** for cloud deployment:

### **‚úÖ What's Working Perfectly:**
```
==> Detected service running on port 10000
Available at your primary URL https://enigma-apex-professional-algo-trader.onrender.com
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Cloud Warnings (Safe to Ignore):**

**1. Desktop Notification Warnings:**
```
UserWarning: The Python dbus package is not installed
UserWarning: notify-send not found
ERROR:root:Failed to send desktop notification: No usable implementation found!
```

**Why this happens:**
- Your app tries to send desktop notifications (great for local use)
- Cloud servers (Linux) don't have desktop notification systems
- **Your app handles this gracefully** with fallback logging

**2. Margin Warning Logs:**
```
INFO:root:üéØ NOTIFICATION [HIGH] - MARGIN WARNING: Margin at 40.0% ($20,000 remaining)
INFO:root:Notification sent: MARGIN WARNING - Margin at 40.0% ($20,000 remaining)
```

**Why this happens:**
- Your Trading Wheels system is **working correctly**
- It's detecting simulated trading conditions and triggering alerts
- Instead of desktop notifications, it logs to the console (perfect for cloud)
